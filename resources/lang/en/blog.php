    'isiberita1'=>'Tokyo (東京 Tōkyō, Japanese: [tokʲo] ( listen); lit. East Capital), officially Metropolis Tokyo (東京都 Tōkyō-to), is one of the 47 prefectures of Japan to have served as the capital of Japan since 1869.[ 6][7] As of 2018, the Greater Tokyo Area was ranked as the worlds most populous metropolitan area.[8] Tokyo is the seat of the Emperor of Japan, the Japanese government, and the Japanese Parliament. Tokyo includes parts of the Kanto area, the Izu Islands, and the Ogasawara Islands.[9] Tokyo was called Edo when Shōgun Tokugawa Ieyasu made the city his headquarters in 1603. The city changed its name to Tokyo after Emperor Meiji made it the capital and transferred his throne from Kyoto in 1868. Tokyo Metropolis was formed in 1943 from the merger of the former Tokyo Prefecture (東京府 Tōkyō-fu) and Tokyo City (東京市 Tōkyō-shi). Tokyo is often referred to as a city, but officially it is a metropolitan prefecture that is very different from a regular city and combines elements of a city and a prefecture',

    'isiberita2'=>'London is the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, and the largest metropolitan area in the United Kingdom. Situated along the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for the two millennia since its founding by Romans in the 1st century under the name Londinium. The center of old London, the City of London, has largely retained its medieval boundaries. Since the 19th century, the name London has also been used to refer to the metropolis that developed around this center. The conurbation of these urban areas eventually formed the London Region and the administrative area of Greater London. This area is governed and subordinated to the mayor of London and the London Assembly who are elected by general election.

     London is a leading global city that excels in the arts, business, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transport.[14] London, together with New York City, is a leading financial center in the world,[15][16][17] and is the city with the fifth largest GDP in the world, or the highest in Europe.[18]',
